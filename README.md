The Smart Pendent is a tiny, wearable RF gadget that helps count the number of people who come into contact with
a coronavirus-infected person. Large organisations found it difficult to locate those people who tested positive for
Covid. Up to 2000 devices can send and receive data through it, and it can also track how many people have come
into touch with infected people. Software that is easy to use, with supreme admin access to every organisation and
the capacity to keep contact data.
